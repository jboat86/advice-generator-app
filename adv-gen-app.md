## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to create API calls using the fetch() method in Javascript:

```js
onst showAdvice = async () => {
  const res = await fetch("https://api.adviceslip.com/advice");
  const data = await res.json();
```

I also got comfortable with using SCSS by creating my own color amd typography-based variables and adding to the main scss file:

```scss
.card-container p {
  margin-bottom: 2rem;
  color: $light-Cyan;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

Due to becoming comfortable with using CSS, I would like to experiment with more advanced SCSS feaures such as mixins, and continue to develop my javascript skills.

### Useful resources

- [Sass documentation](https://sass-lang.com/) - This helped me for understand how to create and use variables in SCSS. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

- [Head First-Learn to Code] - This is an amazing book which helped me understand how API's work. I now understand request must be made to an API where it would fetch the data of your choice (in this case quotes) and generate a response and send it back to your code.
